# 1.10

We have the following procedure which is called `ackermann function`.
```
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

Let's illustratre the example:

```
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 4))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
(A 1 16))
(A 0 (A 1 15))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 14)))
...
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 1)))))))))))))))
...
```

And now we should multiply `2 x 2` 15 times

```
(A 0 32768)
65536
```

We got our result - `65536`.

```
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
```
will be equivalent to a mathematical definition ***n2***
```
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
```
will be equivalent to a mathematical definition ***2^N***
```
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
```
will be equivalent to a mathematical definition ***2 ^ 2 ...  2^ 2*** where amount of twos is equal to ***N***
