So, we have two procedurs one of which has `linear recursive process` and the second has `linear iterative process`:

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```
------------
```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```
Consider the first procedure. Using substitution calculation model we can try to illustrate it.

```
(+ 2 3)
```
will expand as:
```
(inc (+ (dec 2) 3))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 3)))
(inc (inc 3))
(inc 4)
5
```

We see the chain of deferred calculations and make a conclusion it is a `linear recursive process`.

Consider the second procedure. Using substitution calculation model we can try to illustrate it.

```
(+ 2 3)
```
will expand as:
```
(+ (dec 2) (inc 3))))
(+ (dec 1) (inc 4))))
(+ (dec 0) (inc 5))))
5
```
We see obvious state variables and make conclusion that it is a `linear iterative process`.
