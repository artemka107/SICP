# 1.5

```
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

(test 0 (p))
```

So, the difference is the normal order computation will not execute `p` unit we computate our formal params to primitives.

So we got the following expression.

```
(if (= 0 0)
      0
      (p))
```

and then we calculate last expression and got `0` because `0 === 0`.

In case `applicative computation` we got infinity loop.
