#  1.6

We have the following realization of `if` construction.
```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
            (else else-clause)))
```

Of cource, any simple code just like this
```
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5
```
will work, because we do not use recursive construction. As soon as we start to use any recursive function in formal params we will get infinity loop, because first we need to calculate the formal params and then we can use it in our function.
So, the following version will not work:
```
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
             guess
             (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```
because we need to calculatie `(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)` and we do not have the terminal condition, for example `good-enough?`.
