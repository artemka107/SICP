# 2.74

Let's say we have two departments `A` & `B`.
The `A` deparment has the following package for work with personal:

```
(define (A-package-install)
  (define (make-record name salary address)
    (list name salary address))
  (define (get-name record)
    (car record))
  (define (get-salary record)
    (car (cdr record)))
  (define (get-address record)
    (car (cdr (cdr record))))
  (define (get-record name)
    (find (lambda (record) (eq? (get-name record) name)) record-table))
  (define record-table
    (list (make-record 'Ivan 9 'Minsk)
          (make-record 'Jhon 9 'Brest)))

  (define (tag x)
    (attach-tag 'A x)))
  (put 'get-record '(A) get-record)
  (put 'get-name '(A) get-name)
  (put 'get-salary '(A) get-salary)
  (put 'get-address '(A) get-address)
  (put 'make-record '(A) (lambda (name salary address) (tag (make-record name salary address))))
```

and just change some params in our data structure of `B` record:

```
(define (B-package-install)
  (define (make-record salary address name)
    (list salary address name))
  (define (get-record name record-table)
    (find (lambda (record) (eq? (get-name record) name)) record-table))
  (define (get-name record)
    (car (cdr (cdr record))))
  (define (get-salary record)
    (car record))
  (define (get-address record)
    (car (cdr record)))

  (define (tag x)
    (attach-tag 'B x)))
  (put 'get-record '(B) get-record)
  (put 'get-name '(B) get-name)
  (put 'get-salary '(B) get-salary)
  (put 'get-address '(B) get-address)
  (put 'make-record '(B) (lambda (salary address name) (tag (make-record salary address name))))
```

Our generic procedure will look as the following:
```
(define (get-record name deparment)
  ((get 'get-record deparment) name))
```
get-name:
```
(define (get-name record deparment)
  ((get 'get-name deparment)))
```

get-salary:
```
(define (get-salary name department)
  ((get 'get-salary department)
   (get-record name deparment)))
```

find-employee-record:
```
(define (find-employee-record name departments-list)
  (if (null? departments-list)
      #f
      (let ((record (get-record name (car departments-list))))
        (if (null? record)
            (find-employee-record name (cdr departments-list))
            record))))
```
