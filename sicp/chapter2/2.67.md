Let's consider the procedure that decode list of bits and tree:
```
(define (decode bits tree)
  (define (decode-1 bits current-branch)
    (if (null? bits)
        '()
        (let ((next-branch (choose-branch (car bits) current-branch)))
          (if (leaf? next-branch)
              (cons (symbol-leaf next-branch)
                    (decode-1 (cdr bits) tree))
              (decode-1 (cdr bits) next-branch)))))
  (decode-1 bits tree))
```
and also helper procedure for choosing the next branch:

```
(define (choose-branch bit branch)
  (cond ((= bit 0) (left-branch branch))
        ((= bit 1) (right-branch branch))
        (else (error "плохой бит -- CHOOSE-BRANCH" bit))))
```

So, we need to decode sample tree and list of bits:

```
(define sample-tree
  (make-code-tree (make-leaf 'A 4)
                  (make-code-tree
                    (make-leaf 'B 2)
                    (make-code-tree
                      (make-leaf 'D 1)
                      (make-leaf 'C 1)))))

(define sample-message '(0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0))
```

Let's consider the reduction:

```
(decode '(0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) sample-tree)
(choose-branch 0 sample-tree)

next-branch: (make-leaf 'A 4)
current-result: (list 'A)
```
next iteration:
```
(decode '(1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) sample-tree)
(choose-branch 1 sample-tree)

next-branch: (make-code-tree
                    (make-leaf 'B 2)
                    (make-code-tree
                      (make-leaf 'D 1)
                      (make-leaf 'C 1)))
current-result: (list 'A)
```
next iteration:
```
(decode '(1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) (make-code-tree
                                    (make-leaf 'B 2)
                                    (make-code-tree
                                      (make-leaf 'D 1)
                                      (make-leaf 'C 1))))
(choose-branch 1 (make-code-tree
                    (make-leaf 'B 2)
                    (make-code-tree
                      (make-leaf 'D 1)
                      (make-leaf 'C 1))))

next-branch: (make-code-tree
                      (make-leaf 'D 1)
                      (make-leaf 'C 1))
current-result: (list 'A)
```
next iteration:
```
(decode '(0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) (make-code-tree
                                  (make-leaf 'D 1)
                                  (make-leaf 'C 1)))
(choose-branch 0 (make-code-tree
                    (make-leaf 'D 1)
                    (make-leaf 'C 1)))

next-branch: (make-leaf 'D 1)

current-result: (list 'A 'D)
```
next iteration
```
current-result: '(A D)
current-bits: '(0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0)'
```
next iteration
```
current-result: '(A D A)
current-bits: '(1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0)'
```
the next four iteration are very simple too, becase we have `1 0` and `1 0 ` bits and it will be two two `B` symbols
```
current-result: '(A D A B B)
current-bits: '(1 1 1 0)'
```
and the las four iteration give us the `C` and `A`
so the final result is `'(A D  A B B C A)`
