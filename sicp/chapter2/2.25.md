(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))

```
We need to remember that the `cdr` procedure will give as the second element of pair.
`(1 3 (5 6) 9)` list implementaion is `(cons 1 (cons 3 (cons (cons 5 7) 9)))` or `(list 1 3 (list 5 7) 9)`.
So we should remember that our attempts to apply `cdr` to inner list will return the list into list.
To extract the 7 from the following lists we need the following groups of `car` and `cdr`:
```
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
->
cdr
-> (3 (5 7) 9)
cdr
-> ((5 7) 9)
car
-> (5 7)
cdr
-> (7)
car
-> 7
```

```
((7))
->
car
-> (7)
car
-> 7
```

```
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))

cdr
-> ((2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
car
-> (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))
cdr
-> ((3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))
car
-> (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))
cdr
-> ((4 (5 (6 7))))
car
-> (4 (5 (6 7)))
cdr
-> ((5 (6 7)))
car
-> (5 (6 7))
cdr
-> ((6 7))
car
-> (6 7)
cdr
-> (7)
car 7
```
