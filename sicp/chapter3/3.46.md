It's just basic situation.
Let's consider the `test-and-set!` operation:
```
(define (test-and-set! cell)
  (if (car cell)
      true
      (begin (set-car! cell true)
             false)))
```

We have a hole between check condition about `cell` and setting `true` property into cell.

```
1. P1 read cell - false
2. P2 read cell - false
3. P1 set cell to true
4. P2 set cell to true
```

So if we have the one core processor we need to ask our processor
do not give the time `P2` while `P1` work with reading and setting mutex cell.
