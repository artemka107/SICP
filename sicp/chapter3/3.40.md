1. P1 lambda is called fully

x: 100

2. P2 lambda is called fully

x: 1,000,000
```

2.
```
1. P2 lambda is called fully

x: 1000

2. P1 lambda is called fully

x: 1,000,000
```

3.
```
1. P1 lambda has read both x
2. P2 lambda has read all of it x
3. P1 write x - 100
4. P2 write x - 1000
```

4.
```
1. P2 lambda has read all of it x
2. P1 lambda has read both x
3. P2 write x - 1000
4. P1 write x - 100
```

5.
```
1. P1 read x (first one)
2. P2 lambda is called fully

x: 1000

3. P1 read x (second one)
4. P1 wirte x - 10,000
```

6.
```
1. P2 read x (first one)
2. P1 lambda is called fully

x: 100

3. P2 read x (second one)
4. P2 read x (third one)
5. P2 wirte x - 100,000
```

The first 2 examples will be saved if we will serialize them.
