```
a: 10
b: 20
c: 30
```

If wi change it step by step but not concurrently wi will get the same digits but in other order

```
a <-> c : 30 - 20 - 10
a <-> b : 20 - 10 - 30
b <-> c : 10 - 30 - 20
```

So when we try to run it concurrently we will get a different results,
because we have serialized set only in a one particular account,
therefore we got a problems, for example:

```
1. a <-> c AND in this time b <-> c
2. b has been swapped with c

a: 10
b: 30
c: 20

AND after that wi will get wrong amount of money
when trying to change a and c

3. a has been swapped with c

a: 20
b: 30
c: 10

but we wanted

a: 30
b: 10
c: 20
```
