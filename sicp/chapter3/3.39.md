This is very interesting exercise, because we see the one serialized lambda expression and the second not serialized, but the body of it is serialized.
So lets consider a posible options:

```
x: 10
P1: (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
P2: (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))
```

1.
```
1. P1 lambda is called
2. P1 read the x (first one) - 10
3. P1 read the x (second one) - 10
4. P1 write the x - 100

x: 100

5. P2 read the x - 100
6. P2 write the x  - 101
```

2.
```
1. P1 lambda is called
2. P2 called after

(Now the body of P1 can't be called,
because the P2 and the body of P1
are in the same serialized set)

3. P2 read x - 10
4. P2 write x - 11

x: 11

5. P1 read the x (first one) - 11
6. P1 read the x (second one) - 11
7. P1 write the x - 121
```

3.
```
1. P1 lambda is called
2. P1 read the x (first one) - 10
3. P1 read the x (second one) - 10

ATTENTION!

(so the execution serialized expression is over
we can start to execute the second one)

4. P2 read x - 10
5. P1 write x - 100

x: 100

(but we have ALREADY read x for P2)

6. P2 write x - 11
```


4.
```
1. P1 lambda is called
2. P1 read the x (first one) - 10
3. P1 read the x (second one) - 10
4. P2 read x - 10
5. P2 write x - 11

x: 100

(but we have ALREADY read x for P1)

6. P1 write x - 100
```
