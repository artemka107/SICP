Let's consider the following example:

We have a procedure for mapping

```
(define (show x)
  (display-newline x)
  x)
```

And let's refresh our `(delay)` procedure:

```
(define (delay p)
  (mem-proc (lambda () p)))
```

What we see in the `mem-proc` ?

```
(define (memo-proc proc)
  (let ((already-run? false)
        (result false))
    (lambda ()
      (if (not already-run?)
          (begin (set! result (proc))
                 (set! already-run? true)
                 result)
          result))))
```

First of all, the each execution of rest our stream has the state of memory.
If it was be called it won't be called again.
So, let's consider the actions  the following expressions:

```
(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))
-> 0
(stream-ref x 5)
-> 1
-> 2
-> 3
-> 4
-> 5
and each of these elemenet in the stream has remembered the result

(stream-ref x 7)
now it won't call show procedure, therefore the following elements will be showed
-> 6
-> 7
```
