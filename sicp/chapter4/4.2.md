a) Order in our interpreter `cond` matter here. `application` cause is located
in the end because before we will call just simple procedure or expression
we must be sure that we went through all cases.

let's consider the following example:
```
(define x 3)
```

If it was a first option our interpreter, the `definition` clause would work first
and next evaluation would end with success. But now `(define x 3)` just simple expression,
that will be considered as `define - operator` and `(x 3) - list of operands`, but
`define` is a special form of our interpreter.


b) What about another way to move `application` calls before `assignments`?
So we just need to change our `application?` and `operand`, `operator` definitions.

```
(define (application? exp)
  (tagged-list? expr 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
```
