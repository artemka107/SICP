It's quite interesting exercise, we need to change the order of evaluation
regardless of Scheeme order evaluation.
Let's look to the procedure:
```
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-exps? exps)
      '()
      (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env)
            (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env))))
```

We can use the technique as we use for streams,
just wrap the expression we want to eval last into a function.


```
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-exps? exps)
      '()
      ((lambda (first-exp)
         (cons first-exp
               (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))
       (eval (first-operand exp) env))))
```

So we will execute either first or second. Just put the expression we want to evaluate first into lambda arguments.
